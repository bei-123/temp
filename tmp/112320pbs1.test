# from miguel:
# note that if you want to use 40 cores, you need to select 2 nodes, each with 20 cores
# I'm seeing a lot of communication though, so you may be better off using select=1, np=20, and maybe submit more independent jobs if you have more to run

#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=24:mpiprocs=24:mem=30GB:cluster=atlas8

### You can increase mem request if your job needs more mem to run.

#PBS -j oe
#PBS -N Job_Name
###  -N Job_Name: set filename for standard output/error message.
